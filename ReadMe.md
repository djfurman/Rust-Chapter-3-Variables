# Learning Rust

My coding along with the official [RustLang documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)

## [Chapter 3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html)

### Variables and Mutability

Learnings

- Rust variables are immutable unless specified otherwise
- Variables can be shadowed and even change data types after declaration
- Constants are immutable and blocked from override
  - Large numbers can use "_" as a separator and Rust will correctly interpret them
  - This is an amazing feature, especially when dealing with large numbers as it combines readability with execution. Python and Go should adopt this.
